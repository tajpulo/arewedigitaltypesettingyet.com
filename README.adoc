== Who should use it?

Everyone who cares about digital typesetting.

== How does one use it?

* Visit the website to inform yourself about digital typesetting solutions
* If you are a web developer, feel free to submit web design improvements
* If you are a maintainer of a solution, please help to get some facts in the file link:https://github.com/tajpulo/arewedigitaltypesettingyet.com/blob/main/website/_data/projects.yml[_data/projects.yml] straight

Provide a pull request, I will deploy it.

== How does one run it?

If you actually want to build the website, all jekyll files should be in the repository, but I did not document the steps.
I execute â€¦

```
bundle exec jekyll build --source website --destination _site --trace --strict_front_matter
```

in the root directory to generate the website.

== Changelog

v1:: data only showed links to the projects
v2:: more information about each project was added, website lists {license, contributors, publication date, I/O formats}
v3:: implemented feedback by caleb
